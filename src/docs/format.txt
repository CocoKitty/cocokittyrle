FORMAT FOR RLE BIN FILES

the format of the files will be pretty
simple to avoid most bugs, and because
this project has no practical use

file section 1: header
4 byte constant string: "RLE", to verify the file is correct format
8 bit major version: to verify correct version
8 bit minor version: to verify correct version

file section 2: data

(repeated)
	1 byte char: the character
	1 byte uint: the amount of times repeated
